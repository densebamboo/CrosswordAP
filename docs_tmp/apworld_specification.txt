apworld Specification
apworld Specification ¶
Archipelago depends on worlds to provide game-specific details like items, locations and output generation.
Those are located in the   worlds/   folder (source) or   &lt;install   dir&gt;/lib/worlds/   (when installed).
See   world api.md   for details.
apworld provides a way to package and ship a world that is not part of the main distribution by placing a   *.apworld
file into the worlds folder.
Warning:  apworlds have to be all lower case, otherwise they raise a bogus Exception when trying to import in frozen python 3.10+!
File Format ¶
apworld files are zip archives, all lower case, with the file ending   .apworld  .
The zip has to contain a folder with the same name as the zip, case-sensitive, that contains what would normally be in
the world’s folder in   worlds/  . I.e.   worlds/ror2.apworld   containing   ror2/__init__.py  .
Metadata ¶
No metadata is specified yet.
Extra Data ¶
The zip can contain arbitrary files in addition what was specified above.
Caveats ¶
Imports from other files inside the apworld have to use relative imports. e.g.   from   .options   import   MyGameOptions
Imports from AP base have to use absolute imports, e.g.   from   Options   import   Toggle   or
from   worlds.AutoWorld   import   World
